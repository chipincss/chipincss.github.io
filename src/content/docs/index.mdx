Our documentation gives you an insight on our CSS framework and how you can you use it with your website! We hope you enjoy using it as much as we love making it!

## Issue reporting
If you see an issue such as a typo error or some misinformation in a section, we've got you! Here are some ways you can send us an issue report.

- Submit to the GitHub Issue system
- Submit by sending us an email
- Submit via our Discord server

We recommend using the GitHub Issue since it's faster and is more easier for us to track issues more better! It's up to you on how you want to send us a message about your problem! Note that responses may not be seen by us or come through, so you should give us some time to respond to you!
